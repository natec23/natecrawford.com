I'm trying out hosting a blog again. In the past I haven't been very good about keeping up with this, so we'll see what happens!

I'm using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to build the site and then throwing it on github. Especially for something I've given up on in the past, the idea of not having to maintane the site at all is very appealing.
